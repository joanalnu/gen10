# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! To align with our community standards, you can contribute by creating an [issue](#steps-for-creating-good-issues) or submitting a [pull request](#steps-for-creating-good-pull-requests). Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Steps for Creating Good Issues

1. Identify a bug or a feature you'd like to see.
2. Check the [Issues page](https://github.com/joanalnu/gen_api/issues/) to ensure the issue hasn't already been reported.
3. If not, click the green "New Issue" button in the upper-right corner.
4. Choose an appropriate template (if available) or create a blank issue.
5. Clearly describe the bug or feature, following the instructions in the chosen template.

## Steps for creating good pull requests
1. Identify a bug or a feature you're missing.
2. Clone the repository into your machine by running
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/joanalnu/gen_api.git
  ```
4. Access the repository (```cd gen_api```) and create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <your-name>/<new-feature>
  ```
7. Develop your code and run the integrated testing by running ```pytest``` in your terminal. You may find practical to create a python environment with conda while working with this.
8. Once you have finished and passed all tests, stage, commit, and push your branch to the remote repository:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
  git push origin <name>/<new_feature>
  ```
6. Open the remote repository in the browser and create a pull request, describe your changes in a comment, and propose your changes.
7. The pull request will be reviewed and tested by the owners of the repository and approved or closed with feedback.
